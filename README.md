Topological Sorting Simulator - Java, GUI
(CS 310 – Data Structure)
• Utilized Java Universal Network/Graph Framework (JUNG) library to prototype the entire project
• Developed a GUI program to allow user to construct a directed graph based on their preferences
• Built a separate program to support GUI in constructing a graph and performing graph functions such as 
topological sorting(Kahn's algorithm), adding or removing edges/nodes, depth first traversing, and coloring 
nodes
